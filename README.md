# RaycastGame

A simple raycaster engine (Wolfenstein-3D style) written in C++. The program was hacked together quickly as a proof of concept, so the code is low quality but it works.

This repo includes a Visual Studio solution to build the program. You must have SDL2 (https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) installed in C:\Libraries (or you could change the VS solution to point to another folder).

It should be easy to build this for other OSs as it doesn't use any Windows-specific code (that is hidden behind SDL), but I have not done this.
